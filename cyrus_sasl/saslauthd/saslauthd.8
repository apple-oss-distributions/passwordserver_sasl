[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1msaslauthd [22mis a daemon process that handles plaintext authentication
     requests on behalf of the SASL library.

     The server fulfills two roles: it isolates all code requiring superuser
     privileges into a single process, and it can be used to provide [4mproxy[0m
     authentication services to clients that do not understand SASL based
     authentication.

     [1msaslauthd [22mshould be started from the system boot scripts when going to
     multi-user mode. When running against a protected authentication database
     (e.g. the shadow mechanism), it must be run as the superuser.

   [1mOptions[0m
     Options named by lower-case letters configure the server itself.
     Upper-case options control the behavior of specific authentication mecha-
     nisms; their applicability to a particular authentication mechanism is
     described in the [4mAUTHENTICATION[24m [4mMECHANISMS[24m section.

     [1m-a [4m[22mauthmech[0m
             Use [4mauthmech[24m as the authentication mechanism. (See the
             [4mAUTHENTICATION[24m [4mMECHANISMS[24m section below.) This parameter is
             mandatory.

     [1m-O [4m[22moption[0m
             A mechanism specific option (e.g. rimap hostname or config file
             path)

     [1m-H [4m[22mhostname[0m
             The remote host to be contacted by the rimap authentication mech-
             anism. (Depricated, use -O instead)

     [1m-m [4m[22mpath[0m
             Use [4mpath[24m as the pathname to the named socket to listen on for
             connection requests. This must be an absolute pathname, and MUST
             NOT include the trailing "/mux".  Note that the default for this
             value is "/var/state/saslauthd" (or what was specified at compile
             time) and that this directory must exist for saslauthd to func-
             tion.

     [1m-n [4m[22mthreads[0m
             Use [4mthreads[24m processes for responding to authentication queries.
             (default: 5)  A value of zero will indicate that saslauthd should
             fork an individual process for each connection.  This can solve
             leaks that occur in some deployments..

     [1m-s [4m[22msize[0m
             Use [4msize[24m as the table size of the hash table (in kilobytes)

     [1m-t [4m[22mtimeout[0m
             Use [4mtimeout[24m as the expiration time of the authentication cache
             (in seconds)

     [1m-T      [22mHonour time-of-day login restrictions.

     [1m-h      [22mShow usage information

     [1m-c      [22mEnable cacheing of authentication credentials

     [1m-l      [22mDisable the use of a lock file for controlling access to
             accept().

     [1m-v      [22mPrint the version number and available authentication mechanisms
             on standard error, then exit.

     [1m-d      [22mDebugging mode.

   [1mLogging[0m
     [1msaslauthd [22mlogs it's activities via [1msyslogd [22musing the LOG_AUTH facility.

[1mAUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS[0m
     [1msaslauthd [22msupports one or more "authentication mechanisms", dependent
     upon the facilities provided by the underlying operating system.  The
     mechanism is selected by the [1m-aho [22mflag from the following list of
     choices:

     dce        [4m(AIX)[0m

                Authenticate using the DCE authentication environment.

     getpwent   [4m(All[24m [4mplatforms)[0m

                Authenticate using the [1mgetpwent[22m() library function. Typically
                this authenticates against the local password file. See your
                systems getpwent(3) man page for details.

     kerberos4  [4m(All[24m [4mplatforms)[0m

                Authenticate against the local Kerberos 4 realm. (See the
                [4mNOTES[24m section for caveats about this driver.)

     kerberos5  [4m(All[24m [4mplatforms)[0m

                Authenticate against the local Kerberos 5 realm.

     pam        [4m(Linux,[24m [4mSolaris)[0m

                Authenticate using Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM).

     rimap      [4m(All[24m [4mplatforms)[0m

                Forward authentication requests to a remote IMAP server. This
                driver connects to a remote IMAP server, specified using the
                -O flag, and attempts to login (via an IMAP `LOGIN' command)
                using the credentials supplied to the local server. If the
                remote authentication succeeds the local connection is also
                considered to be authenticated. The remote connection is
                closed as soon as the tagged response from the `LOGIN' command
                is received from the remote server.

                The [4moption[24m parameter to the [1m-O [22mflag describes the remote
                server to forward authentication requests to.  [4mhostname[24m can be
                a hostname (imap.example.com) or a dotted-quad IP address
                (192.168.0.1). The latter is useful if the remote server is
                multi-homed and has network interfaces that are unreachable
                from the local IMAP server. The remote host is contacted on
                the `imap' service port. A non-default port can be specified
                by appending a slash and the port name or number to the
                [4mhostname[24m argument.

                The [1m-O [22mflag and argument are mandatory when using the rimap
                mechanism.

     shadow     [4m(AIX,[24m [4mIrix,[24m [4mLinux,[24m [4mSolaris)[0m

                Authenticate against the local "shadow password file".  The
                exact mechanism is system dependent.  [1msaslauthd [22mcurrently
                understands the [1mgetspnam[22m() and [1mgetuserpw[22m() library routines.
                Some systems honour the [1m-T [22mflag.

     sasldb     [4m(All[24m [4mplatforms)[0m

                Authenticate against the SASL authentication database.  Note
                that this is probabally not what you want to be using, and is
                even disabled at compile-time by default.  If you want to use
                sasldb with the SASL library, you probably want to use the
                pwcheck_method of "auxprop" along with the sasldb auxprop plu-
                gin instead.

     ldap       [4m(All[24m [4mplatforms[24m [4mthat[24m [4msupport[24m [4mOpenLDAP[24m [4m2.0[24m [4mor[24m [4mhigher)[0m

                Authenticate against an ldap server.  The ldap configuration
                parameters are read from /usr/local/etc/saslauthd.conf.  The
                location of this file can be changed with the -O parameter.
                See the LDAP_SASLAUTHD file included with the distribution for
                the list of available parameters.

     sia        [4m(Digital[24m [4mUNIX)[0m

                Authenticate using the Digital UNIX Security Integration
                Architecture (a.k.a.  "enhanced security").

[1mNOTES[0m
     The kerberos4 authentication driver consumes considerable resources. To
     perform an authentication it must obtain a ticket granting ticket from
     the TGT server [1mon every authentication request. [22mThe Kerberos library rou-
     tines that obtain the TGT also create a local ticket file, on the reason-
     able assumption that you will want to save the TGT for use by other Ker-
     beros applications. These ticket files are unusable by [1msaslauthd [22m, how-
     ever there is no way not to create them. The overhead of creating and
     removing these ticket files can cause serious performance degradation on
     busy servers. (Kerberos was never intended to be used in this manner,
     anyway.)
